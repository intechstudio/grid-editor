# Profiles
You can find here the first profiles made by intechstudio to explore creative options with Grid. These configurations can be shared, edited and stored on your harddrive. 
*We develop an open profile platform, where users can interact with these profiles in the cloud. Stay tuned!*

## Get Started

Each profile has it's own folder here on GitHub with a description (.md file), about what it can do and how you can use it.
> Some profiles are generic, some are made to be used with DAW or other software.

Profiles are .json files, which represents one page on one module.
> Example: 1st Page of a PBF4 module

The profiles can be made and edited with the Grid Editor software.
> Change the color of a LED by selecting a Control Element's init event and rewrite the red-gre-blu variables to 255 0 0. This sets the LED red!

When you finish loading or editing the profile store your configuration onto the module.
> Once a configuration is stored, you no longer need Grid Editor running.
